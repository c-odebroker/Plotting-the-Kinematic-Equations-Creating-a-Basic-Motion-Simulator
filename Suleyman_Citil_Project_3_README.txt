This program simulates real world rocket launch tests.

Once the program launches, user needs to make selections between the displayed options in the terminal by simply typing.

First, user starts with defining the units they like work with such as empirical for feet, feet/second or metric for meters, meters/second.

Second, user is asked to pick a mode for the simulation test such as free falling or launching upward or custom set.

Free Fall: An object performs a fall at set distance, with no velocity at start.
Launch Upward: An object performs a vertical rise with a velocity set by the user, start distance is held at zero at start.
Custom: User defines the distance from the ground and velocity at start.

Last, user assigns three time intervals to observe the velocity and the distance of the object at each moment.

Note: Default unit is metric and default mode is free fall if there are invalid entries.

Note: Program will warn and display the time and the velocity for the landing/collision for each time intervals entered if the object's position drops below zero.
